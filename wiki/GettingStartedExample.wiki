= Details =

The basic usage of the Simple Astronomy Lib goes like this:
{{{
   MoonPhaseFinder.findFullMoonFollowing(cal)
}}}
Most methods in the API will return a `java.util.Date`

= Example =

  # Download the latest Simple Astronomy Lib jar file from the [http://code.google.com/p/simple-astronomy-lib/downloads/list Downloads page].
  # Create a file `WerewolfCheck.java` with the following contents:
{{{
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.TimeZone;
import com.bradsbrain.simpleastronomy.MoonPhaseFinder;

public class WerewolfCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Chicago"));
        cal.clear();
        cal.set(2011, Calendar.JUNE, 12);

        System.out.println("The next full moon is on: " + MoonPhaseFinder.findFullMoonFollowing(cal));
    }
}
}}}
  # Compile the code
{{{
    javac -cp SimpleAstronomyLib-0.1.0.jar WerewolfCheck.java 
}}} 
  # Run the example
{{{
    java -cp .:SimpleAstronomyLib-0.1.0.jar WerewolfCheck 
}}}  
The output from the above example says the next full moon after June 12, 2011 will be June 15 at 15:25 CDT. 

= A Note on Accuracy =

Currently, the accuracy is within 15 minutes when compared to a page at [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phase2001gmt.html moon phases at NASA] so it's not too far off.  Originally I was looking for accuracy within 6 hours, but will be attempting to improve this. The source I used for calculations isn't the cause since the book I use has more accurate examples. Thus, I'm sure it's due to my implementation.
